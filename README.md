Create a Repository:

You can either create a new repository or use an existing one.
If you're creating a user or organization site, the repository must be named <user>.github.io or <organization>.github.io.
Make sure the repository is public if your account uses GitHub Free or GitHub Free for organizations.
Configure GitHub Pages:

Go to the repository's Settings tab.
Scroll down to find Pages on the left sidebar.
Choose the branch (usually main) as the source for your site.
Click Save. Then wait a minute.
Publish Your Site:

After configuring, you'll see a message like "Your site is ready to be published at 1."
Visit that URL to see your GitHub Pages site!
